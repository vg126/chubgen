# ChubGen - Chub.AI Automation Explorer

**Status**: Research & Development Phase

## Project Overview

This repository explores automation possibilities for the chub.ai character creation platform, with focus on:

- API-based character generation workflows
- Integration with ChatGPT Agent and Perplexity Labs
- Streamlined character and lorebook creation processes

## Current Phase: Research & Verification

### Completed Research
- ✅ ChatGPT Agent capabilities analysis (July 2025 release)
- ✅ Perplexity Labs app generation features
- ⚠️ Chub.AI API documentation (requires verification)

### Research Sources
- [Chub.AI Official Docs](https://docs.chub.ai/docs)
- ChatGPT Agent system architecture
- Perplexity Labs creation engine

### Tools Under Investigation
- **ChatGPT Agent**: Autonomous task completion via virtual computer
- **Perplexity Labs**: Interactive web app generation and deployment
- **Chub.AI API**: Character/lorebook creation endpoints (unverified)

## Prompt Rotation Elements (Blocks)

5-module JavaScript system for systematic prompt variation and character template rotation. Includes AI-powered variable analysis, mathematical combination navigation, intelligent text replacement, dynamic UI generation, and master orchestration layer.

**Usage**: Integrate into Chub.AI Stage development for systematic character generation workflows.

## Project Structure

```
/research/          - Preliminary findings and documentation
/tools/            - Automation scripts and utilities (future)
/examples/         - Sample characters and lorebooks (future)
/docs/             - Verified documentation (future)
/Prompt Rotation Elements (Blocks)/ - Complete prompt rotation system
```

## Development Philosophy

- Direct GitHub operations (no local git workflows)
- Token-efficient automation approaches
- Verification-first development (no assumptions from unverified research)
- Integration-ready for GPT Agent and Labs workflows

## Status Update

Currently in **exploration phase** - all technical specifications require hands-on verification before implementation begins.
