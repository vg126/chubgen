Architecture Overview
---------------------

Chub.AI’s **Stage** architecture provides a modular way to extend chat functionality via a React/TypeScript component that runs alongside the AI chat. Essentially, a Stage is a small web app (an iframe) injected into the chat UI[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=Project%20Structure)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/overview#:~:text=Generally%2C%20yes,stage%27s%20cookies%20or%20storage%2C%20either). It implements a StageBase interface with lifecycle hooks, allowing it to intercept and augment the conversation. For example, the Stage can run code _before_ a user message is sent to the model or _after_ the model’s reply comes back[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=Before%20a%20Prompt)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=After%20a%20Response). This is exactly how a **prompt rotation engine** would integrate: by hooking into the “beforePrompt” stage to modify or enrich the user’s prompt before it’s sent to the LLM, and possibly using “afterResponse” for post-processing results. The existing **Character Stage** foundation in the repository likely provides the skeleton of these functions (constructor, `beforePrompt`, `afterResponse`, etc.), into which the prompt-rotation logic will be inserted. The Stage can append content to the prompt, alter messages, or add out-of-character system notes for the user (e.g. showing debug info or options)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=This%20corresponds%20to%20the%20%27beforePrompt%27,message%20to%20the%20user%27s%20message)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=This%20corresponds%20to%20the%20%27afterResponse%27,message%20to%20the%20bot%27s%20message). Importantly, since the Stage runs client-side in a sandbox, it has no direct access to sensitive user data or platform internals[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/overview#:~:text=Generally%2C%20yes,stage%27s%20cookies%20or%20storage%2C%20either). It communicates with the chat through the defined interface only, ensuring we remain within Chub.AI’s architecture compliance.

The Stage framework is designed to be highly flexible and **cross-platform**. When deployed on Chub, the same Stage code runs on web, iOS, Android, and other devices automatically[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=developers%20in%20mind%20from%20the,of%20it%20is%20built%20in). This means our character-generation Stage (with prompt rotation) will instantly be available to users on all platforms without extra work. The Stage can also leverage standard web tech – we can manage complex state with React hooks or context, and even call third-party APIs from the browser if needed (for example, to fetch synonyms or styles for prompt enhancement)[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=A%20Stage%20is%20a%20software,can%20write%20a%20stage%20yourself). The repository’s “Prompt Rotation Elements (Blocks)” suggests a modular design: likely multiple functions or blocks (e.g. style rephraser, lore inserter, _Imgrok_ enhancer, etc.) that can be applied in sequence to transform the prompt. These will be integrated into the Stage’s prompt-handling hook. One of these modules, the **PromptEnhancer** (possibly related to “Imgrok”), appears to be an advanced prompt augmentation tool – for instance, it might enrich user prompts with additional context or stylistic improvements. We’ll incorporate such modules at the appropriate stage hook so that every user message triggers a rotation through these prompt-enhancement blocks. Overall, the Stage acts as the glue: it initializes with the chat context, manages any persistent variables in its state (so it can remember things like which rotation technique to use next), and ensures the final composed prompt adheres to the format that the downstream Chub.AI model expects. The official CharHubAI template and docs confirm that a Stage project includes a central `Stage.tsx` where this logic lives, plus a `public/chub_meta.yaml` for metadata[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=public%2F%20chub_meta.yaml%20%20,CSS%20styling)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=App,TypeScript%20configuration%20file). In fact, Chub.AI’s stage template is very clear that _“the class you’ll need to fill out and implement is in src/Stage.tsx”_, and the platform handles building and deploying it for you[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=The%20class%20you%27ll%20need%20to,tsx). We will follow that architecture: extending the Stage base class with our character generation logic (prompt rotations, etc.) without deviating from the proven Stage interface patterns.

Community Best Practices
------------------------

Designing high-quality AI characters is as much a creative endeavor as a technical one. The AI community has converged on several **best-practice formats** for character definitions that we can leverage. A foundational concept is to include explicit dialogue examples and roleplay context in the character’s definition – this is the essence of **Ali:Chat style**. In the Ali:Chat format (pioneered by AI creator AliCat), the character’s profile is written as sample dialogues rather than dry prose[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,Plist%2C%20Boostyle%2C%20W%2B%2B%2C%20etc). For instance, instead of saying _“Alice is a shy, bookish girl who speaks softly,”_ an Ali:Chat card might include a mini dialogue snippet showing Alice speaking softly in context. The principle is to “reinforce traits through example dialogues”[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,Plist%2C%20Boostyle%2C%20W%2B%2B%2C%20etc), exploiting the fact that LLMs learn from patterns. Typically, creators fill the Description field with several dialogue exchanges that implicitly convey the character’s personality and background. The **initial message** (greeting) is often a rich, in-character monologue or scene-setting from the character’s perspective, establishing the scenario for the user[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,These%20are%20temporary). Additional **example dialogues** can follow (often separated by special `<START>` tags in some UIs) to demonstrate how the character reacts in various situations[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,These%20are%20temporary). All these serve to “train” the model on the character’s voice and quirks by example. Community guides strongly emphasize that every example line should illustrate a trait or style – nothing generic[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=Important%3A)[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,user%7D%7D%3A%60%20to%20increase%20compatibility). By using Ali:Chat, creators achieve very consistent, in-character AI behavior, since the model picks up the speech patterns, mannerisms, and even formatting from those samples.

Another complementary technique is the **PList format** (short for _Python-List_ style, also known as **Square Bracket Format**). PList is essentially a compact way to list the character’s attributes, preferences, or context in brackets, saving token space. Instead of long sentences, creators enumerate traits in a bracketed list grouped by category. For example: `[Personality: shy, bookworm, kind-hearted]; [Appearance: petite, wears glasses]`. The PList is currently regarded as _“the most token-efficient way”_ to convey many character details[wikia.schneedc.com](https://wikia.schneedc.com/bot-creation/trappu/introduction#:~:text=character%20to%20know%20without%20making,it%20that%20we%20know%20of). It condenses descriptors into comma-separated keywords, often with short parenthetical notes, and the model can absorb these as facts about the character. Many top creators actually combine **Ali:Chat + PList**: they might put a PList block at the top of the description (sometimes after an author’s note or a `<START>` separator) to explicitly state key traits, and then reinforce those traits through dialogue examples below[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,user%20name)[wikia.schneedc.com](https://wikia.schneedc.com/bot-creation/trappu/introduction#:~:text=page,it%20that%20we%20know%20of). This hybrid gives the best of both worlds – explicit facts and rich demonstrations – and has become a gold standard for advanced character cards.

Beyond the character card itself, **Lorebooks** are another community strategy to manage large amounts of world or backstory info. A lorebook is essentially an on-demand knowledge base: creators define keywords tied to chunks of lore or background, and when the conversation hits those keywords, the corresponding text is automatically injected into the prompt[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/advanced-setups/lorebooks#:~:text=A%20lorebook%20is%20a%20series,taking%20up%20permanent%20token%20space). This way, you don’t load all world details into the prompt every time, only when relevant terms come up. For example, a fantasy character might have a lorebook entry for `Magic Guild` – whenever the user or character mentions the guild, a paragraph of lore about it is inserted so the AI stays consistent[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/advanced-setups/lorebooks#:~:text=A%20keyword%20is%20activated%20when,respond%20when%20Apples%20are%20mentioned). This mechanism greatly expands a character’s depth and consistency without bloating every prompt. Community guides on Chub.ai describe that lorebooks can cover settings, supporting cast, or even a character’s hidden secrets, all kept separate until triggered[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/advanced-setups/lorebooks#:~:text=A%20lorebook%20is%20a%20series,taking%20up%20permanent%20token%20space). We should design our system to accommodate lorebook content if needed (for instance, our prompt rotation engine could be aware of lore insertions, ensuring they remain in place during rephrasing).

In summary, the community’s best practices revolve around: (1) **Well-structured Character Definitions** – filling out all fields in Chub AI’s character creator meaningfully (name, persona, scenario, etc.) and using advanced formatting for Description and Example Dialogues; (2) **Ali:Chat style dialogues** to implicitly teach the AI how the character speaks and reacts[rentry.co](https://rentry.co/alichat#:~:text=,Plist%2C%20Boostyle%2C%20W%2B%2B%2C%20etc); (3) **PList trait lists** to efficiently encode factual details[wikia.schneedc.com](https://wikia.schneedc.com/bot-creation/trappu/introduction#:~:text=character%20to%20know%20without%20making,it%20that%20we%20know%20of); (4) **Example Interactions** and multiple **greeting variants** to add depth and variability (users can swipe between alternate intros, each starting with `<START>` in the definition)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/the-basics/character-creation#:~:text=%2A%20Example%20dialogs%20%28Optional%29%20,headers); and (5) **Lorebook entries** to handle expansive lore or dynamic info injection[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/advanced-setups/lorebooks#:~:text=A%20lorebook%20is%20a%20series,taking%20up%20permanent%20token%20space). Following these practices yields much higher quality characters – as evidenced by highly-rated community creations on Chub (the site even showcases _“examples of competently made characters from creators within the community”_ to learn from)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/the-basics/character-creation#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20examples%20of,stars%20if%20you%20enjoy%20them). Our integration of a character creation system should therefore not only handle the technical assembly of a character profile, but also incorporate these proven content patterns. For instance, the prompt rotation engine might generate dialogue-style outputs or format traits in a PList automatically, aligning with community formatting norms. By building on what the community already knows works well, the characters we generate will be more readily accepted as “natural” and high-quality by users.

API Integration Patterns
------------------------

We are considering two main integration pathways for distributing the character creation system with prompt rotation: **within Chub.AI (Stage)** and via **Poe’s platform**. Each has its own API and deployment patterns. On **Chub.AI**, the Stage itself is our integration point – essentially an API between our code and the chat. The Stage interface acts as a mediator: it provides our code with structured data (chat state, user message, etc.) and expects us to return transformed prompts or UI elements. There isn’t a need for an external REST API call to Chub’s backend in most cases; instead, Chub invokes our Stage’s methods at the right times[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=Before%20a%20Prompt). For example, when the user sends a message, our `beforePrompt` can programmatically modify the text or add hidden directives, then hand it back to Chub to send to the model. This is a clean integration – we rely on the Stage API provided by the platform rather than making low-level calls. (Chub’s own web APIs are mostly for things like uploading characters or fetching models, which we likely don’t need to call directly in our Stage.) If needed, though, our Stage could call external APIs from the browser. The documentation explicitly notes that stages can “interact with third-party APIs” to extend functionality[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=A%20Stage%20is%20a%20software,can%20write%20a%20stage%20yourself). We could leverage this for things like hitting a synonyms API or a style-transfer model to assist in prompt enhancement. Since the Stage runs in the user’s context, any such calls would happen client-side. We must be mindful of CORS and authentication in that scenario, but basic GET/POST to open APIs or proxy services (if needed) is feasible.

Moving to **Poe integration**, the approach is quite different: Poe offers a platform for creating bots that either use a fixed prompt (_Prompt Bots_) or forward queries to your custom server (_Server Bots_). A **Prompt Bot** on Poe is essentially a single static prompt (plus optional “invisible” prompt) that prepends every user query. It’s easy to set up via Poe’s Creator interface, but it’s limited – no dynamic logic beyond what can be pre-written in the prompt. This might be too static for our advanced rotation engine, unless we heavily encode rotation logic into the prompt itself (which is brittle). The more powerful route is a **Server Bot**, where we run our own bot logic on a server and Poe relays messages to it. Poe has a well-documented protocol for this: when a user messages the bot, Poe sends an HTTP request to our server with the conversation data, and expects streaming responses back. To simplify development, Poe provides a Python library called **`fastapi_poe`** that sets up a FastAPI server with the correct endpoints. We can subclass their `PoeBot` class and override methods like `get_response` to implement our custom reply logic[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/fastapi_poe-python-reference#:~:text=multiple%20bots%20from%20one%20server,be%20available%20for%20your%20bot)[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/fastapi_poe-python-reference#:~:text=Override%20this%20to%20define%20your,response%20given%20a%20user%20query). In our case, that logic would incorporate the character generation and prompt rotations – effectively doing what the Stage does, but on the server side. The `fastapi_poe` framework will handle packaging our response into Poe’s protocol (which supports sending partial streams, markdown formatting, etc.). One key aspect is **authentication and access control**: when we create a Poe Server Bot, Poe gives us a unique **Access Key** (a string) and expects our server to verify it. The fastapi-poe setup makes it easy – we simply provide that key when creating the app (`fp.make_app(bot, access_key="YOUR_KEY", bot_name="BotName")`) and the library will reject any requests not bearing the correct key[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/fastapi_poe-python-reference#:~:text=multiple%20bots%20from%20one%20server,be%20available%20for%20your%20bot). This ensures only Poe can hit our bot endpoint, and prevents others from abusing it. We’ll need to securely store this key on our server (as an env var or config file) and likely also specify our bot’s name in code as required. Poe’s documentation highlights that certain features (like returning file attachments) won’t work at all unless the access key check is in place[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/fastapi_poe-python-reference#:~:text=multiple%20bots%20from%20one%20server,be%20available%20for%20your%20bot), so proper auth handling is a must.

In terms of **orchestration**, using Poe’s server API gives us full freedom to perform multi-step operations. Our server can, for example, break the character generation into sub-steps: first call one AI model (or function) to draft a character persona, then call another to format it in Ali:Chat style, etc., and finally send the composed result to Poe as the bot’s answer. All of this can happen within `get_response`, hidden from the end user. Poe even allows our bot server to **invoke other bots on Poe** as part of its logic (they have an API for a bot to query another bot) – which could be interesting if we wanted to leverage an existing model on Poe for a sub-task[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=Where%20to%20go%20from%20here). However, we should weigh complexity; often a single well-engineered prompt to one model can do the job, especially if we prompt it to follow the desired format. Still, having the ability to orchestrate multiple calls is an advantage of the server approach. We also note that Poe supports **streaming** responses: our server can yield partial results (e.g. stream out the character card text gradually). We will likely use this to ensure a responsive feel if the generation is lengthy.

**Multi-platform deployment** is a key consideration. By integrating with both Chub and Poe, we cover different user bases. Chub.AI Stage gives us immediate **web and mobile app presence on Chub** (the code once deployed is accessible on all devices via the Chub interface)[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=developers%20in%20mind%20from%20the,of%20it%20is%20built%20in). Poe integration gives us access to Poe’s audience, and Poe bots are also available on web, iOS, and Android through the Poe app. Essentially, each platform (Chub and Poe) handles making our solution available across devices. Additionally, Poe offers an **Embed API** and the concept of **Canvas (UI) Apps**, though those are more for custom UI experiences (which might be beyond our scope, since we already have a UI via the Stage on Chub). For distribution, we may keep the Stage and the Poe bot somewhat separate (the Stage could be for Chub users, and the Poe server bot for others), or even set up the Poe bot to call into our Stage logic if that made sense (though mixing them directly is unlikely; better to have parallel implementations sharing common code where possible). Regardless, employing **FastAPI** on the backend for Poe gives us flexibility to also expose a simple REST API or alternate interface if we ever wanted an external website or integration. For example, we could reuse the FastAPI app to serve a small webpage or accept direct API calls for character generation outside Poe. This is an extensibility win – we’re effectively building a service that isn’t locked to Poe. But initially, Poe and Chub cover our needs: Chub for integrated users, Poe for broad reach (since _“any Poe user can interact”_ with a server bot once it’s set up)[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=In%20this%20quick%20start%20guide%2C,bot%20server%20fits%20into%20Poe).

Deployment Strategies
---------------------

**On Chub.AI (Stage Deployment):** The deployment workflow for stages is straightforward and automated. The Chub AI platform uses GitHub integration to fetch and build stages whenever you push updates. In our repository, we have a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (per the stage template) that triggers on each commit to main, packaging our stage code. To authorize this, we obtain a **Stage Auth Token** from Chub’s API and add it to the repo’s secrets (as `CHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`)[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=This%20project%20uses%20GitHub%20actions,auth%20token%20from%20the%20api). This token essentially lets the GitHub action upload the stage build to Chub on our behalf. The stage template README notes that once this is set up, every commit to main automatically updates the stage in Chub’s catalog[github.com](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template#:~:text=This%20project%20uses%20GitHub%20actions,auth%20token%20from%20the%20api) – meaning developers (or our autonomous agent) can iterate quickly and see changes live. For our project, we’ll follow this pattern: once the character creation stage with prompt rotation is coded and tested, the agent can commit it, and the CI pipeline will deploy it. After deployment, the stage becomes immediately available for use on Chub (private or public depending on metadata settings). We should ensure the `chub_meta.yaml` is filled out with a proper name, description, and tags so that users can discover it. Also, for maintenance, since there’s no persistent database needed, any state we need to keep (like usage counters or configs) can be stored in the stage’s own state or in the Chub platform (Chub might persist some stage data per chat – the documentation mentions initial state, chat state, and message state managed by the platform[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=On%20a%20Swipe%20or%20Jump)). Deployment on Chub is thus low-overhead: no servers to manage, but we rely on the Chub environment and must abide by its constraints (e.g. the sandbox, and the need to be a “Verified” stage for wider user trust perhaps).

**On Poe (Cloud Server Deployment):** Deploying our bot on Poe will involve standing up a web service accessible on the internet. Poe recommends using **Modal** (a serverless hosting platform) for ease of deployment[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=,to%20integrating%20it%20with%20Poe). In their quickstart, they suggest you can just run `modal serve` on your Python bot script and it will spawn a public endpoint in the cloud for you[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=Deploy%20to%20Modal). This is great for development and testing, as it hot-reloads your code. For production, one could use `modal deploy` to keep a persistent service running[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=,instead%20to%20persist%20your%20app). Modal takes care of scalability to an extent, but one could also use other providers (AWS, Heroku, Fly.io, etc.) or even a self-hosted server with a stable URL. The main point is we need an HTTPS endpoint that Poe’s servers can reach. We’ll likely use Modal during development (since it’s integrated in Poe’s guide), and then ensure the deployed endpoint is stable. After deploying, we go to Poe’s bot creation page and choose “Server Bot”, entering our endpoint URL. Poe will generate a **Bot Name** (identifier) and an **Access Key** for us[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=Step%203%3A%20Integrating%20with%20Poe). We then must update our server code to include those (as discussed, pass the access key and bot name in the FastAPI app setup)[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/quick-start#:~:text=Configuring%20the%20Access%20Credentials). This ties our running service to the Poe bot identity. From then on, any user on Poe who chats with our bot will cause Poe to relay messages to our service. We should also plan for **monitoring and logging** on this service – Poe doesn’t expose detailed logs to us, so our server should log requests internally (minus any sensitive info) for debugging. If using Modal, we can use their logs interface.

One advantage of the Poe route is we can iterate quickly in a controlled environment; since our agent can code in Python as well, it could even spin up the FastAPI logic. However, note that our current development environment (the ChatGPT agent) is sandboxed and cannot _directly_ host a public server (no persistent access or open port). So the agent might output the server code, which we then deploy manually or via GitHub to a cloud function. In a longer-term scenario, one could imagine automating deployment to something like Modal via their API, but that’s likely outside our immediate scope. For now, we’ll count on manually deploying the Poe bot server once the code is ready.

**Alternative Distribution:** Beyond Chub and Poe, we should remain cognizant of other channels. For instance, since our solution is essentially a piece of software that generates character profiles, we could package it as a CLI tool or a web app. The ChatGPT Agent’s autonomy means it could create a full project – for example, a simple web UI where users input some parameters and get a character sheet. Deploying that on a platform like HuggingFace Spaces or Vercel could be an idea. That said, the priority is integration into existing ecosystems (Chub.ai and Poe) where the target users already are. Those give us multi-platform reach without building our own userbase from scratch. It’s worth noting that the Stage path and the Poe path are not mutually exclusive: we can maintain the core logic (prompt rotation, formatting, etc.) in a shared library or design, and use it in both deployments. The Stage will use it in TypeScript, and the Poe bot in Python – meaning we may duplicate some logic in two languages, or use the agent to translate one implementation into the other. This is a trade-off of multi-platform support that we accept for greater distribution.

Finally, with any deployment strategy, we must consider **updates and maintenance**. On Chub, updating means committing new code – the platform will handle versioning (and even allows multiple stage versions to exist if needed, though we likely will just update in place). On Poe, updating our bot means updating our server code and redeploying; Poe will instantly use the new logic for new conversations, though ongoing conversations might still reflect older behavior until refreshed. We’ll also want to ensure that any required credentials (e.g. API keys for external services, if used) are stored safely. On Chub Stage, we actually _cannot_ safely store a secret (client-side code can be inspected by users), so we’d avoid any secret-key use in the Stage. On Poe server, we can keep secrets on the server side (like environment variables in Modal) since that code isn’t exposed. Thus, if in the future we integrate an external API (say for image generation or a specialized NLP service), it might be more secure to route those calls through the Poe server or another backend, rather than directly from the stage.

Technical Considerations
------------------------

Developing this system requires balancing advanced capabilities with the constraints of each platform. **Security and Sandbox:** As noted, the Chub Stage runs in a sandboxed iframe – it cannot read the user’s cookies or local storage, nor perform disallowed actions in the browser[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/overview#:~:text=Generally%2C%20yes,stage%27s%20cookies%20or%20storage%2C%20either). This is good from a security standpoint (our stage can’t accidentally leak a user’s session or keys), but it also means if we need to persist data (like user-specific preferences for the prompt generator), we should use the provided Stage state or config schema rather than trying to hack our own storage. We should never ask the user to input sensitive API keys into the stage either (and if we attempted, savvy users and the platform would consider it a huge red flag)[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/overview#:~:text=Still%2C%20no%20amount%20of%20sandboxing,or%20service%2C%20including%20Chub%20itself). The agent should be aware of these boundaries – e.g., if a user wanted to enable OpenAI API usage for the stage, the proper method would be through Chub’s official API integration settings, not through the stage harvesting a key. In short, _Zero trust_ model: our stage code is treated as third-party, so it must behave politely within the sandbox and not expect any privileged access.

**State and Memory:** Chub’s stage interface provides for three levels of state: init state (per chat), persistent chat state, and per-message state[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=On%20a%20Swipe%20or%20Jump). We need to plan what information goes where. For example, our prompt rotation engine might utilize a random or cycling strategy – it could have an index or history of which prompt variants have been used recently. That kind of data could live in the chat-level state (so it persists through the conversation but resets for a new chat). Meanwhile, any one-time info associated with a single turn (like “this user message was enhanced with variant X”) could go into the message state. The platform will feed our stage the relevant state on swipes or edits, which is important if the user rewinds the conversation – we can restore what the stage was “thinking” at that point[docs.chub.ai](https://docs.chub.ai/docs/stages/developing-a-stage/concepts#:~:text=). This complexity means our agent should carefully manage the state to avoid inconsistency, especially if multiple prompt transformations happen sequentially. In testing, we’ll want to simulate scenarios like the user regenerating a reply or going back in time, to ensure our stage state logic handles it.

**Token and Length Management:** One of the goals of prompt rotation and enhancement is to improve the model’s output quality, but we must remain mindful of prompt length. Adding lots of text (synonyms, rephrasings, contextual notes) could push the prompt closer to token limits. The agent should implement smart strategies – for instance, using short placeholders or tags that the model understands, or trimming low-priority details when the prompt gets too long. The community formats we discussed (Ali:Chat, PList) are partly aimed at token efficiency, so adhering to them helps. Also, if using the Chub stage, the platform might have its own prompt length guardrails we should not exceed. On Poe’s side, different models have different context lengths (GPT-4 vs Claude etc.); our server logic might even inspect which model is being used (Poe includes that info in the request) and adjust how much content to inject accordingly. These are advanced considerations, but worth noting to ensure robustness.

**Performance:** The stage’s code executes in the user’s browser, so it should avoid heavy computations that could lag the UI. Prompt rotations (mostly string manipulation) are generally fast, but if we consider something like running a local ML model in the browser, that would be a no-go. If heavier processing is needed, offload it: e.g., ask the LLM itself to do some rewriting, or use a cloud API. Similarly on the Poe server, we have to be conscious of response times. Users won’t wait minutes for a character to generate. We might utilize streaming to show partial results (perhaps start by streaming the name and one-line description, then follow with the full definition) to keep it interactive. The agent could also implement caching on the Poe server – for example, if the same user asks for the same character twice, or if some expensive operation (like fetching a list of popular traits) was done, cache the result to reuse. Also, since our agent can manage multi-step operations, it could generate some data ahead of time. However, one session likely handles one user’s request, so pre-computation is limited.

**Concurrent Usage and Scaling:** With Chub Stage, scaling is handled by the fact that all computation is on the user side (each user’s browser runs the stage). This nicely sidesteps server scaling issues; 10,000 users can use the stage and our code just runs 10,000 times separately on their devices. We just need to ensure no memory leaks or runaway loops in the stage script. On Poe’s server, we _do_ own the scaling problem: if our bot becomes popular, our service must handle many requests. Modal and similar platforms can autoscale to some extent, but we might need to set concurrency limits or queues. The agent could include simple measures like limiting the length of generation to avoid tying up the worker too long. Also, logging and error handling are vital: if one request crashes our logic (e.g., unexpected input format), it shouldn’t bring down the whole service. We should code defensively – validate inputs, catch exceptions in the bot logic, maybe send a fallback message like “Sorry, an error occurred” rather than just failing silently. Poe will display errors to users if our server returns an error status, which could harm user experience or trust. So, robust error handling is a technical must.

**Extensibility and Maintainability:** We are laying the groundwork for an autonomous agent to build and improve this system. Therefore, the design should be modular and clear. The prompt rotation engine should be built in a modular way (which, judging by “Prompt Rotation Elements (Blocks)” in the repo, is already the plan). Each transformation (like “Alternate phrasing block”, “Style enhancer block”, “Image description inserter block”) can be its own function or class. The agent can then add, remove, or tweak these blocks independently in future iterations. We should document (within the code, via comments) what each block does and any best practices it follows (perhaps even citing community sources in comments for future maintainers). This will help the autonomous agent (or any developer) later to make informed changes.

**Compliance with Platform Rules:** Chub AI likely has content guidelines and usage limits (especially if using their models) – e.g., not exceeding certain rate of automated messages, not creating disallowed content. Our stage should adhere to those. If the stage tries to do something outside its scope (like sending a message on its own without user action), the platform might reject it or label it malicious. We should only operate within the triggers provided (before/after user message). On Poe, there are also rules (for instance, Poe does not allow images in responses unless they’re from specific domains, and certain HTML is disallowed in Markdown for security[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/prompt-bots/how-to-create-a-prompt-bot#:~:text=Poe%20supports%20GitHub,support%20additional%20image%20hosting%20sites)). Since our character profiles might include Markdown (bold text, lists, etc.), we should ensure the formatting is compatible. Poe’s docs mention that only images from Imgur and Unsplash are allowed in Markdown for bots[creator.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/prompt-bots/how-to-create-a-prompt-bot#:~:text=Poe%20supports%20GitHub,support%20additional%20image%20hosting%20sites); if our bot tries to put an image link from elsewhere, it won’t render. So if we ever include avatar images or such in the response, we must host them appropriately (perhaps upload to Imgur via their API, or just avoid embedding images in text responses). These are small but important details to ensure the system works uniformly across platforms.

**Testing and Validation:** Given the agent’s autonomous nature, it will be crucial to verify the output on both platforms. We will run local simulations of the Stage (the stage template includes a TestRunner for running it in a dev environment) and sample chats on Chub to see that the prompt manipulation yields the intended effect. For Poe, we’ll test the bot in private before releasing it publicly – checking that the access key is correctly set (requests go through), and that the bot’s outputs are well-formatted (the character cards should appear as nicely readable text, with sections perhaps as bullet lists, etc.). We should also verify that a user can copy the generated character into Chub.ai or another frontend and have it function as a character – this is an end-to-end validation of our creation. The community best practices we incorporated will serve as a checklist: Does the generated profile have a clear description, an engaging first message, a scenario, example dialogue, and optional enhancements like alternate greetings or a lorebook reference? If not, we iterate. The beauty is that our ChatGPT Agent can handle a lot of this iterative improvement once it has this comprehensive context to work from.

In conclusion, the technical landscape for this project is rich but navigable: we have a solid architecture (Stages) to build on, community wisdom to guide quality, multiple integration points (Chub and Poe) to maximize reach, and a clear set of considerations (security, performance, compliance) to respect. With this foundation, our autonomous agent will be empowered to make informed design decisions and implement a sophisticated character creation system that is robust, extensible, and aligned with both **engineering best practices and community expectations**.
