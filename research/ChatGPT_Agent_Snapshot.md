# ChatGPT Agent: A Technical Capability Documentation (as of July 28, 2025)

## 1. Core Architecture & Interface

### 1.1 The Unified Agentic System: A Synthesis of Precursor Technologies

Released on July 17, 2025, ChatGPT Agent is officially designated as a
\"unified agentic system\" operating as a selectable mode within the
standard ChatGPT interface.^1^ Architecturally, it is not a novel model
built from the ground up but rather a sophisticated integration of
previously distinct OpenAI technologies: \"Operator\" and \"Deep
Research\".^2^ Prior to this unification, Operator functioned as an
agent focused on direct web interaction, capable of navigating websites
by clicking, typing, and scrolling, while Deep Research specialized in
conducting multi-step investigations, synthesizing information from
numerous online sources into analyst-level reports.^1^ The July 2025
launch merged these complementary capabilities into a single, cohesive
\"Agent Mode\" accessible from the tools dropdown in any
conversation.^2^

This integration represents a significant architectural evolution. By
combining Operator\'s action-oriented functionality with Deep
Research\'s analytical prowess, OpenAI has engineered a system that can
both gather information and act upon it within a continuous workflow.^3^
The core innovation lies not merely in the availability of these tools,
but in the introduction of a higher-level orchestration layer, referred
to in analyses as a \"Planner & Controller\".^6^ This module
autonomously manages the entire workflow, making informed decisions
about which tool to deploy for each sub-task---for instance, using a
lightweight text-based browser for simple data extraction or a full
visual browser for interacting with complex, dynamic web
applications.^2^ This marks a transition from manual tool-chaining or
simple automation to a more advanced, goal-oriented agentic system
capable of independent reasoning and execution.^3^

### 1.2 The Virtual Computer Environment: Sandboxing and Execution

ChatGPT Agent performs all its tasks within a \"virtual computer,\" a
secure, sandboxed environment that exists within the user\'s browser or
the official ChatGPT desktop and mobile applications.^2^ This
architecture is a foundational security measure, providing the agent
with a dedicated suite of tools---including a terminal, browsers, and a
file system---without granting it any access to the user\'s local
operating system or personal files.^6^ This virtual environment provides
a persistent context for the duration of a single, continuous task,
allowing the agent to execute complex sequences of actions, such as
downloading a file using its browser, manipulating that file in the
terminal, and subsequently generating a report based on the results, all
within one session.^2^

However, observations since its launch indicate that the state of this
virtual environment is ephemeral and not fully persistent between
discrete execution stages of a task. For example, developers have
consistently reported that Python dependencies installed via pip during
an environment setup phase are not available to the agent in the
subsequent code execution phase, leading to errors.^10^ This behavior is
corroborated by official documentation stating that memory capabilities
were intentionally disabled at launch to mitigate security risks like
prompt injection.^11^ This suggests that the virtual computer may be
instantiated as a series of separate, short-lived containers for
different stages of a workflow (e.g., setup vs. execution). While this
design choice enhances security by preventing stateful attacks, it
introduces a significant friction point for developers attempting to
build and test applications that rely on external libraries, directly
impacting the agent\'s ability to create complex, deployable software.
This trade-off prioritizes security over developer flexibility and
defines one of the agent\'s most critical current limitations.

### 1.3 Architectural Components: Planner, Controller, and Model Integration (GPT-4o)

The architecture of ChatGPT Agent is modular, comprising several
distinct components that work in concert. At its core is the GPT-4o
model, which provides the advanced reasoning, language understanding,
and problem-solving skills.^6^ This is governed by a \"Planner &
Controller\" module, which is responsible for decomposing a user\'s
high-level, natural language prompt into a logical sequence of concrete,
executable steps.^6^ An \"Environment Interface\" serves as the bridge
between the agent\'s reasoning and its tools, allowing it to interact
with the virtual computer\'s file system, browsers, and terminal.^6^

This separation of planning (determining what to do) from execution
(performing the action) is a classic agentic design pattern that enables
more robust and complex behaviors. The system\'s ability to select the
appropriate tool for a given sub-task was honed using reinforcement
learning techniques.^3^ Consequently, the agent\'s overall performance
is a function of both the raw intelligence of the GPT-4o model and the
proficiency of the system in using its tools. On internal benchmarks
like SpreadsheetBench, the agent significantly outperforms previous
models, but specifically when it has access to its full tool suite.^2^
This demonstrates that the agent\'s \"intelligence\" is an emergent
property of the entire system. Its capacity to \"think\" is inextricably
linked to its ability to \"act\" through its tools, with the Planner &
Controller adeptly breaking down problems into tool-centric workflows.

### 1.4 The Visual Terminal Interface: Real-Time Execution and Transparency

A defining feature of ChatGPT Agent is its visual interface, which
provides a real-time, transparent view of the agent\'s actions.^3^ This
interface functions as a virtual desktop, showing the user a live
visualization of the agent\'s \"chain-of-thought\" and operations,
including which websites it is visiting, which UI elements it is
clicking, and what commands it is executing.^9^ This level of
transparency is a core design principle intended to build user trust and
facilitate collaboration.^3^

This visual feedback loop transforms the interaction model from an
opaque, \"prompt-in, result-out\" process into an observable and
iterative partnership. Users can monitor the agent\'s progress,
interrupt the task at any point to provide corrective feedback or new
instructions, and then watch as the agent adapts its plan.^2^ For
developers and technical users, this transparency serves as a powerful,
real-time debugging tool. When the agent fails, the visual interface
provides invaluable diagnostic information by showing precisely

*how* it failed---for example, which command produced an error or which
webpage element it could not find. This turns failures from frustrating
dead-ends into actionable learning opportunities, allowing users to
refine their prompts or better understand the agent\'s operational
boundaries, thereby accelerating the human-AI collaborative cycle.

### 1.5 File System and Data Handling: Generated Structures and Manipulable Types

ChatGPT Agent is equipped with a file system within its virtual
environment, enabling it to create, download, read, and manipulate files
and folders.^8^ It can generate and deliver complete, structured project
artifacts, including organized folder hierarchies and pre-written
scripts.^14^ Officially supported output formats include editable
slideshows (e.g.,.pptx), spreadsheets (.xlsx,.csv), and downloadable
reports in various document formats.^2^ User reports confirm its ability
to package entire project skeletons into a single downloadable

.zip archive.^14^

This capability to manage a file system and output structured,
multi-file projects is fundamental to its utility for software
development. The agent moves beyond generating isolated code snippets to
scaffolding entire applications. When prompted, it generates file
structures that follow conventional patterns and best practices for
common frameworks. For instance, when asked to create a React component,
it will suggest and create a standard folder structure, and for a
Node.js application, it will produce a typical layout with public, css,
and js directories alongside a server.js and package.json.^16^ This
knowledge is derived from the vast amount of code in its training data.
However, there is no evidence that the agent can ingest custom
configuration files (e.g.,

.eslintrc, prettierrc, or proprietary project templates) to adhere to
team-specific or non-standard conventions. This makes the agent highly
effective for initiating new, \"greenfield\" projects but limits its
utility for \"brownfield\" development within established codebases that
have strict, custom architectural rules.

## 2. Technical Capabilities Inventory

### 2.1 Code Generation and Execution Environment

#### 2.1.1 Supported Programming Languages and Frameworks

The agent\'s integrated terminal provides a sandboxed environment for
code execution.^2^ While the underlying GPT-4o model possesses knowledge
of a wide array of programming languages, including C++, Java, Go, and
Ruby, the execution environment is primarily optimized for and has
demonstrated proficiency with Python and JavaScript.^18^

Python is the most explicitly supported language, frequently used for
data analysis, automation scripting, and file manipulation, with
demonstrated support for libraries like Pandas and frameworks like
FastAPI.^9^ JavaScript and TypeScript are also well-supported,
particularly for web development. Users have successfully generated and
reasoned about code for front-end frameworks like React and back-end
runtimes like Node.js with Express.^16^ Support is strongest for
mainstream technologies with extensive public documentation and code
repositories, which form the basis of the model\'s training data.^22^

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.1.2 Dependency and Package Management

The agent\'s ability to manage external dependencies is a critical and
nuanced aspect of its capabilities, with significant differences
observed between language ecosystems.

For JavaScript, reports suggest a functional workflow where agents can
install NPM dependencies, allowing them to build and run Node.js
applications that require external packages.^17^ The process appears to
align with standard

npm install and package.json practices.

In stark contrast, the Python environment exhibits a significant
limitation. Multiple user reports and experiments demonstrate a
reproducible failure mode: although the agent can be instructed to run
pip install -r requirements.txt and the command appears to execute, the
agent is subsequently unable to import the installed packages during the
code execution phase, resulting in a ModuleNotFoundError.^10^ This
\"dependency problem\" represents a major bottleneck for complex Python
application development. While the agent can generate the source code
for an application requiring libraries like FastAPI or Pandas, it cannot
internally run or test that code. The user must download the generated
project, manually install dependencies on their local machine, and then
run the tests, breaking the seamless, in-chat workflow. This limitation
effectively relegates the agent to a \"scaffolding generator\" rather
than an end-to-end development environment for most modern Python
projects.

#### 2.1.3 Observed Limitations and Challenges

Beyond dependency management, the agent exhibits other operational
limitations. Tasks can be slow, with execution times ranging from 5 to
30 minutes depending on complexity.^5^ The system is not immune to
technical issues; users have reported that it can crash, lose its
connection, or lose context during long, multi-step workflows.^24^
Furthermore, the underlying model can still hallucinate, producing
factually inaccurate results even when it possesses the tools to verify
the information.^25^ In some cases, workflows fail at the final step,
such as neglecting to click a confirmation button after filling out a
form.^8^ These issues underscore that while the agent is powerful, it is
not yet fully reliable for high-stakes, mission-critical, or
time-sensitive operations, reinforcing the importance of its
transparency and user-in-the-loop design.

### 2.2 Application Generation: Scope and Complexity

Since its launch, users have successfully tasked ChatGPT Agent with
creating a wide range of applications. These include simple data
analysis scripts that download and process CSV files, tools for creating
image collages using web services like Canva, and more complex,
full-stack web applications with both a front-end and a back-end
Express.js server.^8^ In at least one demonstration, an agent was
prompted to build a complete project management application featuring
user authentication, dashboards, and email notifications.^26^ The
agent\'s ability to handle complexity appears to be directly correlated
with the clarity and specificity of the user\'s prompt. Broad,
open-ended requests are more susceptible to failure, whereas
well-defined goals broken into logical, verifiable steps yield more
reliable outcomes.^24^

### 2.3 Internal Code Validation and Testing Mechanisms

#### 2.3.1 Automated Test Execution (pytest, unittest)

A key capability of ChatGPT Agent is its ability to write, execute, and
validate its own code using automated tests. It can be prompted to use
standard Python testing frameworks like pytest and unittest.^28^ The
agent can adhere to software development methodologies like Test-Driven
Development (TDD), where it first generates a comprehensive test suite
based on the prompt\'s requirements and then writes the implementation
code with the goal of making all tests pass.^20^ This internal
validation loop allows the agent to self-correct and verify its work
before presenting a final result to the user.

Further analysis of user experiences suggests that the agent\'s testing
strategy, while powerful, may not be inherently sophisticated. It
benefits significantly from explicit instructions on *how* to test. For
example, one user successfully guided an agent to follow a strict
hierarchical testing procedure: starting with individual unit tests,
moving to full test modules, then complete suites, and finally smoke and
integration tests.^30^ The agent was instructed to \"climb\" this
hierarchy and drop back to a lower level upon any failure. This
indicates that a simple prompt like \"test this code\" is likely less
effective than a more structured prompt that imposes a meta-cognitive
testing strategy on the agent, guiding its debugging process.

#### 2.3.2 Iterative Refinement and Self-Correction Loops

The agent demonstrates a robust capacity for self-correction. When a
test fails, it can analyze the error output and attempt to debug its own
code. It has been observed successfully fixing a range of common
programming errors, including import errors, indentation issues, and
logical flaws in its code that lead to test failures.^20^ This iterative
cycle---write, test, fail, debug, and repeat---is a simulation of the
human development process. The agent\'s ability to perform this loop
autonomously is what distinguishes it as truly \"agentic,\" as it can
actively problem-solve toward a defined goal (passing all tests) rather
than merely executing a single, static instruction.

## 3. Tool Ecosystem

### 3.1 Built-in Tooling Suite

ChatGPT Agent is equipped with a core suite of integrated tools that
form the foundation of its ability to interact with the digital world
and execute tasks.^2^ These tools are orchestrated by the agent\'s
planning module to achieve user-defined goals.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tool Name               Primary Function        Common Use Cases

                          simulating human-like   forms; interacting with
                          clicking, scrolling,    web applications that

                          with limited network    scripts; generating
                          access.                 charts and

                                                  download.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The visual browser is essential for modern web applications, allowing
the agent to \"see\" and interact with pages as a human would.^2^ In
contrast, the text-based browser offers a faster, more efficient method
for data extraction from simpler sites.^9^ The agent is trained to
select the optimal browser for a given sub-task.^2^ The terminal, also
referred to as the Code Interpreter, provides the computational engine
for data analysis and scripting, though its network access is restricted
for security.^4^

### 3.2 External Service Integration via Connectors

Beyond its built-in tools, ChatGPT Agent can integrate with external,
third-party applications through a system of \"Connectors\".^2^ These
connectors provide authenticated, read-only access to user data in
services like Google Drive, Gmail, and GitHub.^4^ This functionality is
a key security feature: connectors allow the agent to passively gather
information (e.g., read a document from Google Drive or scan emails for
keywords) without granting it permission to perform actions.^23^ To
write, modify, or otherwise act within these external services, the
agent must use its browser tool, which typically requires the user to
intervene via \"takeover mode\" to handle the login process
securely.^23^ This design creates a clear and safe separation between
passive data retrieval (via Connectors) and active task execution (via
the Browser).

### 3.3 Research and Information Synthesis Capabilities

The agent\'s research capabilities are a direct evolution of the
precursor \"Deep Research\" tool.^5^ It excels at conducting in-depth,
multi-step investigations across the web. Given a complex topic, the
agent can autonomously find, analyze, and synthesize information from a
multitude of online sources to produce comprehensive reports,
competitive analyses, or personalized summaries.^2^ This is one of its
most mature features, capable of completing research tasks in minutes
that would take a human many hours.^5^ All outputs from research tasks
consistently include clearly labeled source links or screenshot
citations, allowing users to verify the information and trace its
origin.^23^

### 3.4 Data Processing, Analysis, and Visualization

Leveraging its integrated Code Interpreter, ChatGPT Agent can function
as a capable data analyst. It can ingest and process user-uploaded
files, such as CSVs and Excel spreadsheets, and execute Python scripts
to perform complex data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.^27^ For
example, a user can provide a raw dataset and instruct the agent to
identify trends, calculate statistics, and generate visualizations like
bar charts or graphs.^12^ This entire workflow, from data ingestion to
final report generation (e.g., a spreadsheet with new tabs or a slide
deck with embedded charts), can be automated from a single, high-level
prompt.^6^

## 4. Operational Characteristics

### 4.1 Task Decomposition and Multi-Step Project Planning

The essence of ChatGPT Agent\'s autonomous capability lies in its
ability to perform task decomposition. When given a high-level, complex
goal, the agent\'s \"Planner & Controller\" module independently breaks
it down into a logical sequence of smaller, executable sub-tasks.^6^ For
instance, when asked to \"build a website,\" it can create its own
internal to-do list, which might include steps like researching design
patterns, generating HTML for the structure, writing CSS for styling,
and creating JavaScript for interactivity, all without the user needing
to specify each action individually.^7^ This planning capacity allows it
to tackle ambiguous, multi-step projects that go far beyond the scope of
simple question-answering.

### 4.2 Failure Transparency and Error Handling

A core operational characteristic of the agent is its transparency in
handling failures. Instead of returning a generic error message, the
agent\'s visual interface displays the exact point of failure and the
reason for it.^20^ This approach provides two key benefits. First, it
fosters user trust by not obscuring mistakes or limitations. Second, it
offers crucial diagnostic information that allows the user to understand

*why* a task failed. By observing the agent\'s failed attempt, the user
can identify flaws in the prompt, misunderstandings by the agent, or
external issues (e.g., a website change), and then either refine their
instructions or take over manually to correct the course.

### 4.3 Interactive and Interruptible Workflows

ChatGPT Agent is explicitly designed for interactive and collaborative
workflows, not as a \"fire-and-forget\" automation tool.^2^ A key
feature highlighted at launch is the user\'s ability to interrupt the
agent at any point during task execution.^3^ A user can pause the agent
to clarify instructions, provide additional context or data, or change
the goal entirely. The agent is designed to incorporate this new input
and resume its work from where it left off, without losing the progress
it had already made.^2^ This flexibility makes the agent particularly
well-suited for exploratory or iterative tasks where the final
requirements may not be fully known at the outset, allowing for a fluid,
real-time partnership between the human and the AI.

### 4.4 Observed Patterns in Code and Project Structuring

When tasked with generating code or entire project structures, the agent
exhibits a clear pattern of adhering to conventional, widely accepted
best practices for the specified technology stack.^16^ For example, it
will generate a standard folder structure for a React application or a
typical project layout for a Node.js and Express backend.^17^ These
patterns are derived from the vast corpus of public code on which the
underlying model was trained. This behavior is highly advantageous for
quickly scaffolding new projects with a standard, recognizable
architecture. However, as noted previously, this reliance on common
patterns means the agent is unlikely to correctly replicate bespoke,
proprietary, or unconventional project structures, limiting its
applicability for contributing to existing projects with rigid and
unique architectural conventions.

## 5. Integration & Deployment

### 5.1 Application Handoff: Formats for Delivery (ZIP, Individual Files)

Once ChatGPT Agent completes a development task, it provides the
generated artifacts to the user for handoff. It can deliver individual
files, such as .pptx presentations, .xlsx spreadsheets, or .csv data
files, directly as downloadable links within the chat interface.^9^ For
more complex software projects, the agent can package the entire
application---including a full directory structure with subfolders and
pre-written scripts---into a single, downloadable

.zip archive.^14^ While the ChatGPT interface does not have a native
\"create zip\" button, the agent leverages its internal Code Interpreter
(terminal) to programmatically generate the zip file from the contents
of its virtual file system.^33^ This ability to deliver a zipped project
archive is a critical feature for developer workflows, as it preserves
the file structure and component relationships, allowing a developer to
easily download, extract, and begin working with the code in their local
environment.

### 5.2 User-Led Deployment Pathways (Vercel, AWS, Google Cloud)

It is crucial to note that ChatGPT Agent\'s role concludes at code
generation and packaging; it does not deploy applications to live
servers. The deployment process is entirely user-led and relies on
standard DevOps practices and tools. User reports and technical guides
show that applications generated by the agent are commonly deployed to
major cloud platforms, including Vercel for front-end and full-stack
applications ^34^, Amazon Web Services (AWS) for services like Lambda
and EKS ^36^, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for services like App
Engine and Cloud Run.^38^ The agent can assist in this process by
generating necessary configuration files, such as a

Dockerfile for containerization or an app.yaml for Google App Engine,
but the user remains responsible for setting up the cloud environment,
managing credentials, and executing the final deployment commands.

This reveals a significant \"deployment gap\" in the agent\'s end-to-end
workflow. Deployment requires securely handling sensitive credentials
(API keys, cloud provider secrets) and executing authenticated
command-line tools (vercel deploy, gcloud app deploy).^34^ For security
reasons, the agent\'s terminal is heavily sandboxed with limited network
access and is architecturally prevented from accessing the user\'s local
machine, environment variables, or secret stores.^6^ It is therefore
incapable of performing the final, critical step of pushing code to a
production environment. This hard stop in the automation pipeline means
that while it can generate a \"deployable application,\" it cannot
function as a \"deploying agent.\"

### 5.3 Production-Readiness and Included Documentation

The code generated by ChatGPT Agent should be considered a high-quality
first draft rather than a production-ready artifact. While the agent can
be prompted to include documentation, such as comments and docstrings,
the thoroughness of this documentation is entirely dependent on the
user\'s instructions.^16^ Official guidance and user experience both
stress the need to manually review, validate, and test all
agent-generated code before deploying it to a production
environment.^40^ The previously discussed dependency management issues,
particularly in the Python ecosystem, are a major barrier to
out-of-the-box production-readiness, as the code cannot be fully
validated within the agent\'s own environment.

## 6. Use Case Analysis

### 6.1 Developer-Centric Applications: Automation, Debugging, and Prototyping

For software developers, ChatGPT Agent serves as a powerful productivity
multiplier, often described as a \"senior developer, researcher, and QA
engineer in one\".^16^ It is widely used to accelerate the initial,
often time-consuming phases of development. Common use cases include
generating boilerplate code for new components in frameworks like React
^16^, rapidly prototyping new ideas, exploring unfamiliar frameworks
like FastAPI by asking the agent to generate a starter project ^16^,
automating the testing of API endpoints, and debugging existing code by
providing scripts and asking for analysis and fixes.^16^

### 6.2 Non-Developer Utilization: Research, Analysis, and Content Creation

For users without a technical background, ChatGPT Agent democratizes
access to powerful computational and analytical capabilities. It is
frequently used to conduct complex research tasks that would otherwise
require specialized skills, such as analyzing public financial data from
municipal budget reports and compiling the findings into a structured
spreadsheet.^31^ Other popular uses include planning complex events and
travel itineraries ^27^, automatically generating polished presentations
and reports from raw data or research notes ^2^, and automating
multi-step business workflows like HR employee onboarding or sales lead
management.^43^

### 6.3 Emergent and Innovative Applications from Early Adopters

In the weeks following its launch, early adopters have discovered
creative and innovative applications by combining the agent\'s diverse
toolset. One notable example comes from a photographer who used the
agent as a location scout. By providing a detailed prompt with aesthetic
requirements (e.g., \"industrial, gritty, abandoned warehouse\") and a
geographic area, the agent browsed the web, identified potential
locations, and compiled the results into an organized spreadsheet
complete with contact information and rental costs.^41^ Another user
tasked the agent with finding products (ceramic mugs) that visually
matched the style of their company website; the agent used its visual
browser to analyze product images and identify suitable candidates.^41^
In the financial domain, a cryptocurrency trader successfully used the
agent to automate a workflow that fetched live market data, calculated
technical indicators like Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), and flagged
potential trading signals in real time.^15^ These use cases highlight
that the agent\'s most powerful applications often involve translating a
qualitative, strategic, or aesthetic goal into a series of concrete,
automatable actions that leverage its full suite of tools.

## 7. Technical Differentiation

### 7.1 Comparison with Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

ChatGPT Agent represents a different paradigm from a traditional
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or
JetBrains IntelliJ. An IDE is a toolbox that provides a developer with
tools for writing, debugging, and managing code, but requires the
developer to perform every action manually. The agent, by contrast,
functions more like an autonomous craftsperson that uses its own
internal tools to achieve a high-level goal provided by the user.^44^
Its value lies not in the tools themselves, but in the autonomous
planning and orchestration of those tools.

### 7.2 Advantages of the In-Chat, Real-Time Execution Model

The primary advantage of the agent\'s in-chat, real-time model is the
significant reduction in context-switching for the user.^16^ A developer
or researcher can investigate a topic, generate code, analyze data, and
test results all within a single, unified interface. This cohesive
experience can dramatically lower the cognitive load and reduce the
barrier to entry for starting new projects or experimenting with
unfamiliar technologies. The interactive and interruptible nature of the
workflow fosters a fluid, conversational partnership between the human
and the AI, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration.^2^

### 7.3 Impact on the Development Process and Human-AI Collaboration

The introduction of ChatGPT Agent signals a potential paradigm shift in
the role of the human in the software development lifecycle. The user\'s
role evolves from that of a \"doer,\" who manually writes every line of
code, to that of a \"director\" or \"delegator,\" who provides
high-level strategic goals and then oversees the agent\'s tactical
execution.^45^ Effective use of the agent requires new skills, primarily
in prompt engineering, task decomposition, and the ability to articulate
clear, outcome-focused objectives.^46^ The development process becomes a
collaborative dialogue, where the human\'s core competency shifts toward
effectively communicating intent to their AI partner.

This shift points toward the emergence of new development methodologies.
The most successful and complex outcomes reported by users invariably
stem from highly structured, detailed prompts that meticulously define
the goal, constraints, and desired output formats.^27^ This is giving
rise to what might be termed \"Prompt-Driven Architecture,\" where the
master prompt and its associated instructions become a primary design
artifact, as critical as the source code itself. Similarly, the ability
to guide the agent through a TDD workflow suggests a new practice of
\"Agentic TDD,\" where developers architect and validate systems by
defining test cases in natural language for the agent to implement and
pass.^20^ In this new model, debugging often involves refining the
prompt rather than fixing the code, elevating prompt engineering from a
simple technique to a core software design disc
